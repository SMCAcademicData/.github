## Welcome to SMC Grades

A github orgnization that stores all the work done to help make Santa Monica College (SMC)'s grade distribtuion data and class schedule more accessible!

This project is divided into the following:
- `Grade Distribution Transformer`: a python script that transforms .xlsx files created from SMC's grade distribtuion PDFs into usuable .csv and .json files. This tool was created to allow me to easily transform and upload the data into a database.
- `Class Schedule Scrapper`: a python script that scrapes all available class schedules made public by SMC and creates .csv files out of them.
- `SMC Grades API (Backend)`: a set of routes and functions that take SMC's grade distribution data and allow you to pull and manipulate from a database (created by yours truly).

This project is currently a work in progress.
Currently Working On: `Class Schedule Scrapper`
