## Welcome to SMC Grades

A github orgnization that stores all the work done to help make SMC's grade distribtuion data accessible!

This project is divided into three aspects:
- `Grade Distribution Transformer`: a python script that transforms .xlsx files created from SMC's grade distribtuion PDFs into usuable .csv and .json files. This tool was created to allow me to easily transform and upload the data into a database.
- `SMC Grades API (Backend)`: a set of routes and functions that take SMC's grade distribution data and allow you to pull and manipulate from a database (created by yours truly).
- `The Site (Frontend)`: a website where you can access, view and interact with SMC's grade distribution data and that will help inform you on what classes and professors to take.

This project is currently a work in progress.
Currently Working On: `The API (Backend)`
