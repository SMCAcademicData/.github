## Welcome to SMC Grades

A github orgnization that stores all the work done to help make SMC's grade distribtuion data accessible!

This project is divided into three aspects:
- `The Pipeline`: a set of Python scrpts that help take SMC's grade distribution pdfs into viewable and interactable csv files!
- `The API (Backend)`: a set of routes and functions that take SMC's grade distribution data and allow you to pull and manipulate from a database (created by yours truly).
- `The Site (Frontend)`: a website where you can access, view and interact with SMC's grade distribution data and that will help inform you on what classes and professors to take.

This project is currently a work in progress.
Currently Working On: `The Pipeline`
